# ChestX-ray8 Datasheet

A [dataset datasheet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) for the [ChestX-ray8 dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315), a.k.a. ChestX-ray14.

Dataset datasheets "Document \[the dataset\] motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses, and so on. \[They\] have the potential to increase transparency and accountability within the machine learning community, mitigate unwanted biases in machine learning systems, facilitate greater reproducibility of machine learning results, and help researchers and practitioners select more appropriate datasets for their chosen tasks." ([from the original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010)).

Based on the [datasheet for dataset template in Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/datasheet-for-dataset-template/jgqyyzyprxth).
